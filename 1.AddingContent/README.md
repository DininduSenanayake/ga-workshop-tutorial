## Adding content to your workshop

Work in progress...

### Some notes:

1. Organisation structure for repository
    - Numbered folders per topic (preserves order)
    - README.md within each folder (auto-display)
    - Images stored within sub-folder (relative path)
2. Formating
    - Use of `<img>` tag to allow resizing etc
    - Use of backticks to highlight `files` and or `commands`
    - Inclusion of code blocks via ```

        ```
        Code block
        ```
3. Content requirements
    - data files (on Github or externally linked?)
    - software requirements (plus versions used)
    - code to be run
4. NeSI-specific points

5. Additional considerations
    - ability to run workshop locally (i.e. not on NeSI systems)
